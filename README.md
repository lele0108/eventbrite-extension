# eventbrite-extension

Created for EventBrite Technical Project Interview.

Technologies used:
* Angular
* Bootstrap
* jQuery (required by Bootstrap)
* localStorage caching

API's used:
* EventBrite API
* Wit.ai (used for natural language proccessing)

Readme:
Install the /app folder of the repo. Users can type anything they want such as "Hackathons this weekend in San Francisco" and the NLP engine will 
determine the event query, location, and time the user wants to search. Manual input is also possible.

Be vary that due to the constrained time, I was not able to train Wit.ai very well, so results of NLP are not always perfect. Given more time, 
Wit.ai would get smarter and have higher accurary when proccessing data. 

Good examples to use:
Hackathons near San Francisco this month
Parties near Berkeley this weekend
Music near San Jose this month
Parties near San Francisco on Saturday
